## PWA Text Editor

## Description
This project is a browser-based text editor that offers a seamless and efficient user experience, both online and offline. Built as a Progressive Web Application (PWA), the text editor ensures data persistence through IndexedDB, allowing users to reliably create and store notes or code snippets for later use. The application is bundled using Webpack, features a service worker for offline functionality, and can be installed directly onto a user's desktop.


## Installation
To install this application:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory and run npm install to install dependencies.
Ensure you have IndexedDB supported by your browser.

## Usage
To use this text editor:

1. Run npm run start from the root directory to start the backend and serve the client.
2. Open the application in your browser.
3. Begin typing to create notes or code snippets. The content will automatically save to IndexedDB when the DOM window is unfocused.
4. To install the application on your desktop, click the 'Install' button in the browser.
